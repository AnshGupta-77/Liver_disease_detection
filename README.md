# Liver_disease_prediction_model
This project aims to predict the presence of liver disease in patients using supervised machine learning techniques. It utilizes a dataset containing various medical parameters such as age, gender, bilirubin levels, and enzyme markers. The project includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation using classification algorithms like Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Naive Bayes. A comparison of model accuracy is also visualized for performance analysis.

## Key Features:

### Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handled missing values and encoded categorical data to prepare for machine learning.
###Feature Scaling: Standardized input features using StandardScaler for improved model performance.
###Model Implementation: Built and trained two classifiers â€” Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Naive Bayes.
###Performance Evaluation: Compared model accuracy using accuracy_score for objective evaluation.
###Visualization: Displayed accuracy comparison through a clean and informative bar chart using matplotlib.
###Modular Code Structure: Organized and readable Python script for easy understanding and reproducibility.

## Required modules:
### NumPy
pip install numpy
### pandas
pip install pandas
### matplotlib
